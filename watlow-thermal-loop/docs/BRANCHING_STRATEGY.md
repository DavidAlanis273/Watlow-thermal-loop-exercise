## Why Gitflow?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Parallel work | Multiple features can be developed simultaneously without stepping on each other |
| Clean history | `main` only contains released, working code |
| Safe integration | `develop` acts as a staging area — breaks stay here, not in production |
| Clear releases | Tags on `main` mark exactly what was shipped and when |

## When to Use Each Branch Type

### `feature/*`
You're adding something new. In this project, each page section gets its own feature branch.

### `hotfix/*`
Something is broken in production (`main`). Branch off `main`, fix it, merge back into both `main` and `develop`.

```
main     ●────────●────●
                  │    ▲
                  ▼    │
hotfix            ●────● hotfix/fix-broken-link
```

### `release/*`
All features for a version are merged into `develop`. Create a release branch for final polish and version bumps before merging into `main` and tagging.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Branching from `main` instead of `develop`** — features should always branch from `develop`
2. **Giant feature branches** — if a branch has 50+ changed files, it's too big. Break it up.
3. **Merging without reviewing** — even solo, look at your own diff before clicking merge
4. **Forgetting to pull** — always `git pull origin develop` before creating a new branch
